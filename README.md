- ⚡ Fun fact:
Did you know that the first bug in a computer program was an actual insect?
In 1947, a team of engineers was working on the Harvard Mark II computer when they found a moth stuck in one of the relays. They taped the moth to the computer log and wrote "First actual case of bug being found" next to it.
From then on, any glitch or error in the program was referred to as a "bug," and the term has stuck ever since!
